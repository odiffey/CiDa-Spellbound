          When developing/sourcing assets I came to a number of barriers. For instance when sourcing pictures of galaxies for the splash screen many images were branded or you had to pay to use them, so I had to spend some time finding a suitable image to use. When it came to creating a logo for spellbound and Calm UK, I came to some difficulty due to a creative block and the lack of 3D modeling programs on the school system, this meant that the final logos were not something I was 100% happy with. Audio was fairly easy to source as there are a number of copyright-free music websites on the ether.

          <div class="btn-dvs" onclick="window.open('./Evidence/Demo video Storyboard.pdf','_blank')">Trailer Storyboard</div>
          The demo video was fairly simple to plan out as I had a clear image in my mind of what I wanted the end product to be, within reason unlike some of my other ambitious projects.

          <div class="btn-eop" onclick="window.open('./Evidence/Project Review.pdf','_blank')">Project Review</div>
          The end of project review was a challenge to compile as writing about my work isn't my strong point. Despite this it was a nice experience to be able to see all my previous works from the project and see how my skills have evolved over the course of a year and a half.

          <div class="btn-qp" onclick="window.open('./Evidence/Quiz - How it works.pdf','_blank')">Quiz Plan</div>
          The quiz plan was designed to guide me through each stage of the quiz and how it would work. The original plan was to have the quiz on web pages utilizing hyper links and buttons however this would have taken much longer than creating the quiz on PowerPoint, which is what I did in the end.

          <div class="btn-mtwp" onclick="window.open('./Evidence/Meet the wizard plan.jpg','_blank')">MTW Plan</div>
          The meet the wizard was fairly simple to plan as I knew exactly what I wanted. However the end result wasn't everything I wanted due to limitations of software, more animation would have been good to add.

          <div class="btn-nsp" onclick="window.open('./Evidence/Navigation Screen Plan.pdf','_blank')">Nav Screen Plan</div>
          My navigation screen was based off of a commonly used asset known as bootstrap. Its a simplistic style but effective for its use however I did not add the logo as I originally intended, as I was dissatisfied with it.

        <div class="col s12 m3 l3">
          <div class="btn-ps" onclick="window.open('./Evidence/Proposal Spellbound.pdf','_blank')">Proposal</div>
          When creating the proposal I was very new to the project and didn't know what to expect from it. My plan was very much one of complication and I was unable to stick to what I had planned to due to limits with the schools hardware and software and my own ability to complete projects of a large scale in a short time frame.

          <div class="btn-wp" onclick="window.open('./Evidence/Wizard Plan.pdf','_blank')">Wizard Plan</div>
          Designing the wizard was a challenge as I am not a very creative person, however I did manage to create a simplistic design through the use of word. The wizard that is now in use was in fact the plan I made in word and I decided to use the wizard I made using the shapes feature in word as I started the course a few months late so I had to speed up the rate of which I worked.

          <div class="btn-mtws" onclick="window.open('./Evidence/Meet The Wizard Script.pdf','_blank')">MTW Script</div>
          Compiling a script for the meet the wizard was some what of a challenging process for someone like myself who lacks the capability to creatively plan. I made the script to clearly state the key points of the Meet The Wizard in a tone that the younger audience would understand.
