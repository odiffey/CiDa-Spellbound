          <div class="btn-mtw" onclick="window.open('./Products/meetthewizard.html','_blank')">Meet the Wizard</div>
          The meet the wizard was targeted originally to demonstrate the quiz without the use of sound, once completed it did feel as if it was missing something and so a voice over was added to make the character come to life allowing for a more immersive experience for the user.

        <div class="col s12 m3 l3">
          <div class="btn-nav" onclick="window.open('./Products/navigation.html','_blank')">Navigation Screen</div>
          The navigation screen followed the simplistic themes found in css/js scripts such as bootstrap. The original plan was to have the spellbound logo in the center however the logo isn't amazing and it would ruin the simplistic design I was going for.

        <div class="col s12 m3 l3">
          <div class="btn-cu" onclick="window.open('./Products/contact.html','_blank')">Contact Us</div>
          The contact screen was fairly simple to throw together as the splashscreen was already in a position to be adapated for this use. It worked out by simply adding some extra text in a contrasting colour to make the information stand out.

        <div class="col s12 m3 l3">
          <div class="btn-ss" onclick="window.open('./Products/index.html','_blank')">Splashscreen</div>
          The splashscreen has be through 2 phases. The first had a bland background and text that could have easily been missed but now a gradient is used to allow text and images to stand out more.

          <div class="btn-qu" onclick="javascript:quiz();">Quiz</div>
          The quiz was where my functional side could really do its justice. I designed it to be easy to use for the younger children that the software is aimed at. I really enjoyed developing the quiz as it was simplistic yet methodical. The original idea for the quiz was to use a website instead of PowerPoint however due to the lack of software on the school machines I was unable to do it in this way.

          <div class="btn-dv" onclick="window.open('./Products/trailer.html','_blank')">Demo Video</div>
          The demo video was an exciting project to work on. I know how to video edit so that watching a video is not a bore. I think that the video is informative and enjoyable to watch even if the quality has to be lesser than appropriate due to the file size limits.
